-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
svlib PRE-PRE-PRE-ALPHA release, for consumption only amongst consenting adults
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS:

- unzip the archive somewhere convenient (you already did that, otherwise
  you wouldn't be reading this file)

- write your SV code, using the following spells as required:

    `include "svlib_macros.svh" // only if you actually need the macros
    module WHATEVER_YOU_LIKE;
      import svlib_pkg::*;

- Write code using svlib features, taking your cue from the sketchy
  documentation in the paper and slides
  
- Compile, preferably using your tool's one-step compile such as
  qverilog, irun, vcs. If <dir> is the place where you find this file,
  ensure that your command line contains:
    +incdir+<dir>/src <dir>/src/svlib_pkg.sv <dir>/src/dpi/svlib_dpi.c
  
- Additionally, for VCS only, you will need not only "-R -sverilog" but also
    -LDFLAGS -lrt

There is still a lot of functionality missing or incomplete - the file
pathname manipulations are particularly iffy. Some other stuff, notably 
regular expressions and INI file reading, should be good to go.

Good luck and please tell me about EVERYTHING that goes wrong!

thanks
Jonathan
